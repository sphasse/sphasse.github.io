Here’s the timeline of what has now been a six year journey with our automated side-loading garbage truck model:

# Timeline
## 2018 
We spend the year developing the automated garbage truck idea, iteratively working through at least 18 distinct prototypes and having friends and family play test and provide design feedback. We believe our side-loading arm mechanism is a novel innovation. We have not been able to find anything like it prior.
## January 2019 
We officially submitted our Automated Garbage Truck project to LEGO Ideas. This was the month Levi turned 13 and we were finally eligible to submit as a team. We carefully reviewed the terms including the assignment of rights and chose to submit our idea. You can find all the terms at https://ideas.lego.com/terms, and we went through all of them at submission time. Our social media campaign to promote our LEGO Ideas submission begins.
## January 19, 2019
We [post our idea to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/ahlxnp/we_finally_did_it_an_actual_working_lego/) and it becomes one of the most popular LEGO subreddit Ideas posts of all time.
## May 2019 
Mack announces the Mack LR Electric electric garbage truck (the actual truck, not the LEGO set)
## October 2019 
We participate in Brickworld Chicago 2019, with tons of kids playing with our truck design and the bin arm mechanism. Beyond the Brick releases a video recorded at the end of our participation in Brickworld Chicago 2019.
## November 6, 2020 
JK Brickworks releases a fantastic video describing our mechanism in detail. This video helped us reach 10k supporters a few weeks later.
## November 26, 2020 
We achieved 10,000 supporters and were chosen for inclusion in the Third 2020 Review. This began a process of signing NDAs and copyright assignment. This re-affirms our assignment of all rights for our idea to LEGO. We again consciously choose this assignment of rights.
## January 16, 2021 
It came to our attention that nearly brick-for-brick (minus internal details) cloned versions of our idea were being sold in various online marketplaces. We reached out to LEGO to clarify we had no involvement in these and were not profiting in any way and asked for help defending the intellectual property that we assigned to LEGO. This was shared with the LEGO legal team. To this day thousands of those sets continue to be sold. Lots of people praise the companies that copied our design for how clever they are.
## June 16, 2021 
Another clone company releases two sets with a different truck design (in orange and green) using our side-loading mechanism. Again they are praised for their clever design and we get no credit or compensation. These sets are sold in physical stores in Germany.
## June 21, 2021 
Our [fan designer interview](https://ideas.lego.com/blogs/a4ae09b6-0d4c-4307-9da8-3ee9f3d368d6/post/40f4e6ca-9fbc-4968-97c0-b2afa56dbbd6) is posted. You might wonder why this was posted the day before the review results were announced. We were hopeful the delay in our interview might mean something positive for our review result, but unfortunately it was because the Ideas team simply forgot about us. We contacted them when it was announced that the review results would be shared on June 22. Realizing their mistake they published our interview shortly after. So don’t assume that things always go smoothly once you reach 10k supporters.
## June 22, 2021 
The third 2020 review results are announced (https://ideas.lego.com/blogs/a4ae09b6-0d4c-4307-9da8-3ee9f3d368d6/post/93c95063-4c17-44a2-91ce-80a60cc3950c). We received communication that the LEGO Group will not produce a set based on our project. The clock starts ticking on three years until rights for the truck design revert back to us.
## December 2023 
LEGO announces they will be producing a side-loading garbage truck https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/mack-lr-electric-garbage-truck-42167 available for purchase in January 2024.
## January 15, 2024 
Series 4 of the BrickLink Designer Program begins accepting submissions. We weren’t able to participate in any prior BrickLink Designer Program Series as Levi was not yet 18 and you have to be 18 to enter the BDP. Levi turned 18 in January 2024 so this will be the first time we are eligible to enter that program.
## January 26, 2024 
Our project is accepted into BrickLink Designer Program series 4.
## March 18, 2024
Bricklink series 4 finalists are announced. Our truck project is not chosen nor are any small projects.
## February 5, 2024 
The BrickLink Designer Program series 4 crowd support phase starts.
## June 22, 2024 
The three-year date from LEGO not selecting our product idea. After this time we are again free to sell any items, physical or digital, related to our product idea.   
## December 6, 2024
We release instructions and our design on [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-203494/MochiMaster/automated-side-loading-garbage-truck/#details)
