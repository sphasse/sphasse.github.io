As a parent, a lot of my quality time was spent on the floor playing with my kids in a pile of LEGO bricks. We loved looking at the latest sets in the catalogs, and one of our favorite pastimes was to pull up instructions online and “improvise” new sets with parts on hand. Christmas packages were eagerly shaken to identify any potential LEGO gifts.

Our LEGO Ideas journey started when my younger son was 11 years old. He had been watching some of the LEGO Designer videos and expressed curiosity about working for LEGO as a designer. I let him know there was a program called LEGO Ideas. If you’re not familiar with LEGO Ideas, it is an official LEGO program that allows you to submit a set idea. If your idea gets 10,000 supporters, LEGO may make your idea into an official LEGO set. We looked at the rules and saw you needed to be 13 to participate, so we started trying to figure out a workable product idea. After over a year of iterative design refinement, we came up with and submitted a city-scale automated side-loading garbage truck with a working bin arm.

As a part of LEGO Ideas submission we (along with anyone else who submits an idea to LEGO Ideas) assigned full rights and permission to our idea worldwide to LEGO. They are allowed to use any submitted idea in any way and for any purpose. So they did not “steal” our idea. We read and knew these terms prior to submission and made a conscious decision when we submitted our idea.

At the time we submitted our project, nothing else like our bin arm design existed in terms of the size, purpose, and how it functioned. We believed and still believe that our bin arm design was novel and represented real innovation.
