# Introduction
This page contains details on all of the potential precursor mechanisms that we are aware of. Please take a close look at all of these potential precursor, and compare the significant differneces between each of these mechanisms and our design, compared to the small differences between our bin arm design and the bin arm design in set 42167. The fundamental question is: Would the side loading bin arm of set 42167 exist as it is if we had not innovated and released our bin arm design via LEGO Ideas? LEGO says it would (“no inspiration”), but we think the answer is pretty clear that it would not.

But it is worth understanding the potential precursor mechansims in detail, as this has come up in forum discussions about our set. We’ve even seen comments like “The mechanism they copied from sets 8094, 8868 and 8479 in the first place.” and “It could be argued that that Ideas project's author was the one who stole the idea from LEGO: that kind of grab-and-lift mechanism was already present at least in 8094, 8479 and 9736.” so these are claims we take quite seriously. 

It is easy to see the substantial differences and how huge and clunky all of those mechanisms are. There important differences are:

* Scale. Our design is much smaller and more compact than any of those designs. Creating a side-loading bin arm that works reliably at minifigure scale was a huge challenge for us.
* Method of force transmittal: Our mechanism uses an asymmetric gear train.
* Function: Our design smoothly grabs and dumps the contents of a container and returns the empty container to the ground. None of these do that.
* Our mechanism is hand operated and all of these are motorized.
* Temporal proximity: It has been 25 years since the most recent of those sets. LEGO set 42167 and the cloned copies of our submission show there has been plenty of market demand for a functional bin arm design if one had existed. LEGO set 42167 was released shortly after our LEGO Ideas project, in fact during the three-year time period when LEGO still had rights to our project via our LEGO Ideas submission. 

Let’s take a close at all of the sets that have been brought to our attention that allegedly use the same mechanism:

## Set 8094 “Control Center” “The Picker” mode:

Released in 1990. This is not a “grab and dump” mechanism, but rather a robot arm “grab and lift” mechanism using a base of parallel beams with a very limited range of vertical motion and no change in the orientation of the grabbed object. The mechanism is about 40 studs in size. The mechanism uses about twice as many gears as our design to actuate the grabbers.

## Set 8479 “Barcode Multi-Set”:

Released in 1997. This is a “grab and drop” mechanism for the front of a truck. The mechanism takes a completely different approach to transmit the force to actuate the grabbers (flexible cable-like linkages) rather than a gear train. The grabbers open at the top of the lift, dropping whatever was lifted into the truck. The mechanism is about 25 studs in size.

## Set 8868 “Air Tech Claw Rig”
Video of the mechanism: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1u8Q2tmpl4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1u8Q2tmpl4) (B model)

(Can’t find a link for instructions)

Released in 1992. The B build of this set is a “grab and drop” mechanism for the front of a truck. It uses pneumatics rather than gears to transmit the force, with separate pneumatic cylinders to actuate the grabbing mechanism and the lifting mechanism. The mechanism opens the grabber at the top of the lift, dropping whatever it is lifting into the truck. The mechanism is about 30 studs in size.

## Set 9736 “Exploration Mars“ “Robotic Arm” mode:

Released in 1999. This is also not a “grab and dump” mechanism, but rather a “grab and lift” mechanism for a robot arm with a very limited range of vertical motion. It does not use a gear train to transmit force to the grabber, but rather rigid linkages. The mechanism is about 20 studs in size.

## Great Ball Contraptions
People have said “That mechanism has been implemented in LEGO before (e.g. GBC)”. We are not aware of any mechanism that is similar in implementation, scale, and function that predates our LEGO Ideas submission. We are talking about something very specific. There are many Great Ball Contraption modules that move balls in novel ways, but we are not aware of any lift and dump mechanisms that predate our Ideas submission.

## First LEGO League
People have said this sort of mechanism has been implemented in First LEGO League. Again, we are talking about something very specific in terms of scale and function. We are not aware of any FLL mechanisms that predate our Ideas submission.
