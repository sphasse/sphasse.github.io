This post describes some experiences my son and I had as we walked the path of designing and submitting our Automated Side-Loading Garbage Truck project to the LEGO Ideas program. For our bottom line lessons and the link to download free truck plans, scroll to the end.
You may have seen our truck design either in the [LEGO Ideas program](https://ideas.lego.com/projects/7d7f4e15-55e7-44c4-bb30-3a66b9cc0598) in the third review in 2020 or more recently in series 4 of the BrickLink Designer Program.

Both of those competitions are completed, so we’re not trying to promote our project in any way. What we are trying to do is set the record straight. After LEGO released their [42167 Mack LR Electric Garbage Truck](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/mack-lr-electric-garbage-truck-42167) set with a bin arm very similar to our design, people have contacted us to ask if it was our design, and there have been third party videos with titles like “Is Lego Stealing People’s Designs?”. 
The short answer for us is no, but we want to share our full perspective to help set the record straight with respect to the bin arm design of our truck project and the bin arm design LEGO released with the 42167 Mack Electric Garbage Truck set. If you’ve ever thought about submitting to LEGO Ideas, our experience may hold some lessons for you. This article is fairly long and winding, like our journey designing the truck and submitting it to LEGO Ideas.

As a parent, a lot of my quality time was spent on the floor playing with my kids in a pile of LEGO bricks. We loved looking at the latest sets in the catalogs, and one of our favorite pastimes was to pull up instructions online and “improvise” new sets with parts on hand. Christmas packages were eagerly shaken to identify any potential LEGO gifts.

Our LEGO Ideas journey started when my younger son was 11 years old. He had been watching some of the LEGO Designer videos and expressed curiosity about working for LEGO as a designer. I let him know there was a program called LEGO Ideas. If you’re not familiar with LEGO Ideas, it is an official LEGO program that allows you to submit a set idea. If your idea gets 10,000 supporters, LEGO may make your idea into an official LEGO set. We looked at the rules and saw you needed to be 13 to participate, so we started trying to figure out a workable product idea. After over a year of iterative design refinement, we came up with and submitted a city-scale automated side-loading garbage truck with a working bin arm.

As a part of LEGO Ideas submission we (along with anyone else who submits an idea to LEGO Ideas) assigned full rights and permission to our idea worldwide to LEGO. They are allowed to use any submitted idea in any way and for any purpose. So they did not “steal” our idea. We read and knew these terms prior to submission and made a conscious decision when we submitted our idea.

At the time we submitted our project, nothing else like our bin arm design existed in terms of the size, purpose, and how it functioned. We believed and still believe that our bin arm design was novel and represented real innovation.

Welcome to our site. This is where we share the full story of our process of designing and submitting an automated side-loading garbage truck project to the LEGO Ideas program. Our path has been a long and winding one, but with the return assignment of all rights to the project to LEGO expiring in June 2024 and our subsequent release of free plans [on rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-203494/MochiMaster/automated-side-loading-garbage-truck) our journey with this project is now basically complete. 

It turns out there was a lot of demand for a functional minifig-scale side-loading bin arm. Since we originally released our design on LEGO Ideas, it has been widely implemented by fans, by skilled designers like JK Brickworks who have expressed their admiration of the design, and by several unscrupulous companies that copy creative design work without giving any credit or compensation. 

Specifically, Lepin released [a nearly brick-for-brick clone](https://its-not-lego.blogspot.com/2021/06/garbage-truck-moc-c5333-lego-ideas-jk.html) of our design and XingBao released [two sets](https://www.brickmeupscottie.com/products/new-xingbao-18016-18017) with a redesigned truck using our bin arm design.

Additionally, in January 2024, LEGO released the 42167 Mack LR Electric Garbage Truck set with a functional side-loading bin arm similar to our design. We believe our bin arm design inspired the bin arm on LEGO set 42167 and that LEGO set 42167 would not exist in the form it does today unless we innovated the automated side-loading bin arm mechanism and shared the idea on LEGO Ideas.

LEGO does not see it that way. After set 42167 was announced, we reached out to Hasan Jensen at LEGO Ideas and the LEGO Ideas team, and this was a part of Mr. Jensen’s response (bold emphasis mine):

> Unfortunately, this means we will not be able to provide any credit, as inspiration for this design [set 42167] is not connected to your design.
> --Hasan Jensen, Community Activation Manager, Community Management and Moderation 1/16/2024

We think the inspiration is quite obvious just by looking at what existed prior and the two mechanisms, how they are integrated into the trucks, and how they function. We’ve had a lot of people reach out and tell us the same. We also understand that there are plenty of people who will jump to the defense of LEGO in this situation. We’re huge fans of LEGO ourselves and LEGO has been a significant part of our lives and will continue to be in the future. However, The LEGO Group is a huge corporation that ultimately does what is in their best interest. 

We do believe that LEGO Ideas submissions are treated separately from other internal LEGO development processes, and that they did not intentionally set out to copy our mechanism from our Ideas submission. They have the right to do what they did, even if it was inadvertent. However, it would have cost them basically nothing to give some credit where credit was due. In cases where there is real innovation and direct inspiration we think they should do that.

As we’ve discussed this issue in various forums some common themes and questions have come up. The rest of this article attempts to address those questions. Again, if you’d just like the downloadable instructions, jump to the bottom.

Questions and answers are below.

## Question: Just another garbage truck?
*Hasn’t the LEGO group released lots of garbage trucks in the past already?*

Our specific claim is about the implementation of the side-loading bin arm mechanism only. We believe that implementation of our side-loading mechanism is novel in terms of the scale, functionality, and purpose. None of the LEGO garbage trucks prior to set 42167 had a functioning side-loading mechanism. A number of them (6693, 30313, and 60386 for example) did have clunky manual mechanisms for dumping trash cans. We are not claiming that the idea of a LEGO garbage truck is novel. Our claim is that our functional side-loading bin arm mechanism is novel. Of course LEGO has made lots of garbage truck sets and will continue to do so.

## Question: Independent design?
*Couldn’t the LEGO designer have come up with the design independently from yours?*

If you watch any of the LEGO Designer videos, you can see that the LEGO designers are passionate professionals. They do not design “clean room” implementations, but dive into their subject matter deeply and do extensive research.
Our LEGO Ideas submission happened before the real-life Mack LR Electric Garbage Truck was announced, and almost four years before the announcement set 42167. We know LEGO product development timelines can be long but we think this timeline eliminates the possibility of parallel development. So for a LEGO designer to come up with the design independently, they would have to be assigned the job to work on a Mack automated side-loading garbage truck design and have no awareness of:

* Our original LEGO Ideas submission
* Our popular Reddit r/lego post announcing the truck on LEGO Ideas
* The JK Brickworks video highlighting our bin arm mechanism
* The Beyond the Brick video highlighting our truck project
* The many clone sets using our bin arm mechanism
* The intellectual property that LEGO owns (assigned by us) which includes the digital design and building instructions of our truck and mechanism that we submitted as a part of reaching 10k supporters on LEGO Ideas
* And that they did no research once being assigned the project that would create awareness of any of those things. And then they created the set 42167 bin arm mechanism in a vacuum. To us this seems so unlikely that it is not plausible.

This could be clarified by asking the designer of set 42167, but as far as we are aware, LEGO has not released who designed the set nor have they come forward to provide their perspective. Nor has the designer of the set come forward to take credit as happens often on Brickset for instance. We are not sure why, but we would love to get their perspective. Milan Reindl has said in a 42167 review video that he did not design 42167.

## Question: LEGO started before you?
*Couldn’t LEGO have been developing set 42167 since before your truck project was submitted?*
It was well over four years between our LEGO Ideas submission and the announcement of set 42167. Here’s a brief timeline of our submitted project:

* January 2019: We submit our idea to LEGO ideas
* November 2020: We reach 10,000 supporters thanks to an active social media campaign and in particular a video showcasing our bin arm design by JK Brickworks
* June 2021: LEGO announced they would not be making a set based on our idea
* December 2023: LEGO announces the 42167 Mack Electric Garbage Truck set
* January 2024: We submit our design to the BrickLink Designer Program series 4 and LEGO set 42167 is released
* February 2024: We are not chosen as a part of the BrickLink Designer Program series 4
* June 2024: Rights from our submitted idea reverted back to us

LEGO sets sometimes do take multiple years to develop. However, Mr. Jensen from LEGO Ideas told us: 

> In regard to the MACK LR Electric Garbage Truck 42167, this was developed in partnership with our long-term collaborators at MACK Trucks, with whom we also have launched 42078 Mack Anthem in 2018 based on designs of their vehicle. 42167 is an extension of that partnership based on the MACK LR Electric Garbage Truck vehicle (as would be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQFtAnm7D-c), which includes a side-loading function as part of the real vehicle. When entering into partnerships with license holders, it’s not uncommon to have a longer-term roadmap and vision for that partnership, including products that may come in the future.
> --Hasan Jensen, Community Activation Manager, Community Management and Moderation 1/16/2024

If set 42167 was in development before our LEGO Ideas submission, it seems that LEGO would have plainly stated that like they did with the Ghostbusters Firehouse Headquarters set or the Jurassic Park T-Rex Rampage set. They did not do that. Based on all that, it seems very unlikely to us that set 42167 could have been under development prior to our LEGO Ideas submission. Even if it was, the function of the specific function of the bin arm is what we are discussing in this article. This could also be definitively answered by the designer of set 42167.

## Question: Not novel?
*Haven’t other LEGO sets used this same mechanism? Your mechanism is not novel and/or other LEGO sets have used the same mechanism.*
If you look at the designs for LEGO side-loading garbage truck mechanisms before and after we released our design, it is clear that our design was innovative for the purposes of an automated side-loading garbage truck bin arm. It has been frequently copied after being released. There was plenty of market demand for a functional LEGO side loading bin arm if one had existed. But one did not exist until we released our design. 

In various forums where this issue has been discussed people have pointed to other potential precursor mechanisms (sets 8094, 8479, 8869, and 9736 for instance). We’ve even seen comments like “The mechanism they copied from sets 8094, 8868 and 8479 in the first place.” and “It could be argued that the Ideas project's author was the one who stole the idea from LEGO: that kind of grab-and-lift mechanism was already present at least in 8094, 8479 and 9736.” 

Please check those sets out for yourself to see the clear and stark differences in scale, method of actuation, and purpose from those sets to our arm mechanism. It has been 25 years since the most recent of those sets, and in the meantime no one except for us innovated a functional automated side-loading bin arm. Conversely, the side loading bin arm mechanism in set 42167 is very directly similar to our mechanism in scale, method of actuation, and purpose.

People have also pointed out that great ball contraptions and first LEGO league robots use mechanisms like our bin arm. There are certainly a lot of creative mechanisms used for those, but none of those have translated into a working side-loading garbage truck bin arm.

## Question: Isn't LEGO prevented from copying LEGO Ideas?
*Isn't LEGO prevented from copying ideas from LEGO Ideas in the terms?*

LEGO has the rights to do literally whatever they want with your submitted idea, but that is not what they told us. Mr. Jensen from LEGO Ideas told us (bold emphasis mine):

> In regards, to your message around LEGO Ideas and the rights to your submission, I think it’s worthwhile, and very important, for me to clarify that while you correctly point out that we do retain the rights to submissions for a period of 3 years after they have not been approved, expired, or archived, **it does not allow the LEGO Group to do what we want with your submission**. It’s very important for us that our members are treated fairly and consistently when it comes to the compensation that is due and have built the LEGO Ideas experience to ensure that this happens in a systematic and correct way. That being said, LEGO Ideas as a platform for fan submissions is not a platform that’s used by our internal teams as inspiration to create future sets. It’s critical to the integrity and success of LEGO Ideas that LEGO Ideas submissions are treated separately from our internal product development process and that these two processes do not overlap.
> --Hasan Jensen, Community Activation Manager, Community Management and Moderation 1/16/2024

But this is clearly not true. Anyone submitting an idea to the LEGO Ideas program should be aware of this. Specifically from the [LEGO Ideas terms](https://ideas.lego.com/terms) version 3.0 that you can find online (bold emphasis again mine):

> ...you hereby assign all rights worldwide to the content generated by you to LEGO System A/S, meaning that **we and our co-marketing partners can use your contributions in any way and for any purpose**, including to reproduce, manufacture, copy, adapt, modify, perform, display, publish, sell, broadcast, transmit, or communicate to the public by any means whether now known or unknown and distribute your contributions for the whole duration of protection granted to intellectual property rights by applicable laws and international conventions.

LEGO, via Mr. Jensen’s comment, is claiming to hold themselves to a higher standard with the goal of treating their members fairly, but legally per the LEGO Ideas terms they clearly and absolutely have the rights to absolutely anything they wish with submitted designs. My son and I are lifetime fans of LEGO, but it is important to keep in mind that LEGO is a huge corporation with a lot of moving parts that ultimately at the end of the day is about making money. The Ideas program and BDP are big business.

## Question: Isn't the design obvious?
*Isn’t the design obvious? There’s really only one way to implement it.*

Everything is obvious in hindsight. LEGO set 42167 and the cloned copies of our submission show there has been plenty of market demand for a functional bin arm design if one had existed. The reality is that no one had come up with a functional side-loading bin arm mechanism at minifigure scale prior to our Ideas submission. Respected designers like JK Brickworks and Wintergatan have praised our design as brilliant, which we don’t think they would do if the design was obvious.

## Question: Isn't LEGO innocent in previous cases like this?
*LEGO has been accused of copying LEGO Ideas sets before and didn’t that turn out to not be true?*

Ours is a very different situation from sets like the Ghostbusters Firehouse Headquarters or the Jurassic Park T-Rex Rampage. Those are making a representative model of movie intellectual property, and so the kind of overlap that happened in those cases is likely to occur sometimes. For our situation, we implemented a specific mechanical mechanism that does not work the same way as actual real-world,side-loading bin arms function. Real-world side-loading bin arms are hydraulic or (in the case of the Mack truck) perhaps electric. Rather, we created, in a novel and elegant way, an analogous side-loading bin arm function on a small scale via Technic and LEGO bricks.

## Question: Are you stirring up trouble?
*Why are you raising this issue? Is it just to create a controversy?*

Our aim is to set the record straight and share the facts of our journey from our perspective. We think our experience should be understood by people intending to participate in the LEGO Ideas program as it promises to foster creativity and innovation in builders of all ages.
As my son and I reflect on our whole journey with this project, knowing what we know now we really wouldn’t do anything differently. We’ve both learned so much about so many more things that we never thought we would at the start. We’re proud that our design has had a significant influence on how LEGO trash gets collected. We want to celebrate that by sharing the instructions for free.

## Question: Instructions already!
*So where can I get instructions for the truck?*

You can get the instructions at [our page on Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-203494/MochiMaster/automated-side-loading-garbage-truck/#details). 

Thank you for reading through our whole perspective, please share yours!
