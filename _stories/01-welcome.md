This post describes some experiences my son and I had as we walked the path of designing and submitting our Automated Side-Loading Garbage Truck project to the LEGO Ideas program. For our bottom line lessons and the link to download free truck plans, scroll to the end.
You may have seen our truck design either in the LEGO Ideas program in the third review in 2020 or more recently in series 4 of the BrickLink Designer Program.

Welcome to our site. This is where we share the full story of our process of designing and submitting an automated side-loading garbage truck project to the LEGO Ideas program. Our path has been a long and winding one, but with the return assignment of all rights to the project to LEGO expiring in June 2024 and our subsequent release of free plans [on rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-203494/MochiMaster/automated-side-loading-garbage-truck) our journey with this project is now basically complete. 

We've divided our story up into multiple posts to hopefully make it easier to digest and navigate. 

If you want the short version: we feel that our side-loading bin arm design was novel and that it clearly inspired the side-loading bin arm design that LEGO included with set 42167, the [Mack LR Electric Garbage Truck](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/mack-lr-electric-garbage-truck-42167). LEGO has officially told us our project provided no inspiration for set 42167, and we disagree. Although we do not think LEGO set out to intentionally copy a LEGO Ideas project they chose not to make, in this case we think LEGO should do the right thing and give credit where credit is due.

But you should make your own decision. You can find our full perspective in the subsequent posts here.
