Welcome to our site. This is where we share the full story of our process of designing and submitting an automated side-loading garbage truck project to the LEGO Ideas program. Our path has been a long and winding one, but with the return our rights assignment to LEGO expiring in June 2024 and our subsequent release of free plans [on rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-203494/MochiMaster/automated-side-loading-garbage-truck) our journey with this project is basically complete. 

We've divided our story up into multiple posts to hopefully make it easier to digest and navigate. If you want the short version, we feel that our side-loading bin arm design was novel and that it inspired the side-loading bin arm design that LEGO included with set 42167, the [Mack LR Electric Garbage Truck](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/mack-lr-electric-garbage-truck-42167). LEGO has officially told us our project provided no inspiration for set 42167, and we think that is absolutely ridiculous. 

But you should make your own decision. You can find our full perspective in the subsequent posts here.
